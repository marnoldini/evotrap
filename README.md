The R scripts detmodel_EDfig5D.R, parscan_EDfig5B.R, and plotting_EDfig5.R, contain the code used to generate extended data figure 5 in the paper 
titled "Directing an evolutionary trade-off in Salmonella via intestinal antibodies" by Diard et al, published in Nature Microbiology in 2021.

The script detmodel_EDfig5D.R contains code to run a deterministic simulations to generate the data used for the plots in extended data figure 5D, 
and saves this data in csv files. 

The script parscan_EDfig5B.R contains code to run deteministic simulations to generate the data used for the plots in extended data figures 5B and C, 
and saves this data in csv files.

The script plotting_EDfig5.R contains code to read the data generated by the other two scripts, and uses this data to generate the plots. It also calculates
the switching rates from O12-0 to O12-2 (and vice versa), based on the simulations and the measured final fractions in experiments.
